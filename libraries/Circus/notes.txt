- x.setup() - setup the pins (input and output) 
- x.attract_mode() 

- common routines between games: 
  - winner() 
  - looser() 
  - next_level() 
  - score() 

- game.init()  
    - hand over array of leds 
    - hand over array of sensors 

- game.play()
    - set_level() 
      nr_leds to light up 
      led_ms() to turn on 
        
    - hand over array of sensors 



    - move to next level() 

- start - hand over sensors (input and output devices) 


- how to implement different games ? 
  different games have the same sensors - they will hae different levels
