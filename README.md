## Whack-a-mole 

### Summary 
This is a small project which emulates the whack-a-mole game on an Arduino mega. 

### Details
This repository holds various iterations and versions and is basically my build-log. The end-product is some large-size whack-a-mole game with 
- RGB LEDS which light up to be whacked 
- vibration sensors which have to be whacked 
- an indicator for the level you are in 
- additional control of propane poofers which are controlled by 5V relais.
